Starting and Using Screen
1. Start a new screen session
bash# Start with a descriptive name

screen -S churn_analysis

# Or just start unnamed session
screen

2. Run your analysis
bash# Inside the screen session, run your Python script

python your_churn_analysis_script.py

3. Detach from screen (keep it running)
bash# Press: Ctrl + A, then D
# This detaches but keeps the process running

4. Exit SSH safely
bash# You can now safely exit SSH
exit

ðŸ”„ Reconnecting Later

1. SSH back into AWS
bashssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-ip

2. List existing screen sessions
bash# See all running screen sessions
screen -ls

3. Reconnect to your session
bash# Reconnect to named session

screen -r churn_analysis

# Or reconnect to session by ID
screen -r 12345

# If only one session exists
screen -r

ðŸ“‹ Useful Screen Commands
Inside a screen session:

Ctrl + A, then C â†’ Create new window
Ctrl + A, then N â†’ Next window
Ctrl + A, then P â†’ Previous window
Ctrl + A, then " â†’ List all windows
Ctrl + A, then D â†’ Detach session
Ctrl + A, then K â†’ Kill current window
exit â†’ Exit current window

From command line:

screen -ls â†’ List sessions
screen -r session_name â†’ Reattach to session
screen -X -S session_name quit â†’ Kill session remotely

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for AWS Batch Processing
1. Start with logging suppressed:
pythonanalyzer = run_enhanced_churn_analysis(
    data_path="/path/to/data",
    output_path="/path/to/output", 
    suppress_console_logging=True  # Perfect for screen sessions
)
2. Check progress without entering screen:
bash# Check if your Python process is still running
ps aux | grep python

# Monitor log files in real-time
tail -f logs/churn_analysis_*.log
3. Complete workflow example:
bash# 1. SSH into AWS
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance

# 2. Start screen session
screen -S batch_analysis

# 3. Run your analysis (with console logging suppressed)
python churn_analysis.py

# 4. Detach (Ctrl+A, then D)

# 5. Exit SSH
exit

# 6. Later: SSH back in
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance

# 7. Check if still running
screen -ls

# 8. Reconnect
screen -r batch_analysis
This setup is perfect for long-running churn analysis jobs that might take hours to complete! ðŸŽ¯RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
