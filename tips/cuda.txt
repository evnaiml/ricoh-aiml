# PyTorch offers pre-built binaries that include specific CUDA runtime dependencies. 
# While you have CUDA 12.4 installed on your system, the PyTorch binaries you install 
# will ship with their own CUDA runtime. To install a PyTorch version compatible with 
# CUDA 12.4, you should use the official PyTorch installation instructions and select 
# the CUDA 12.4 option during the installation process. For example, using pip, 
# the command to install PyTorch with CUDA 12.4 would typically look like this:
# 
# pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
