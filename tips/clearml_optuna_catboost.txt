The ClearML platform allows you to orchestrate and manage hyperparameter optimization tasks, including distributed training across multiple GPUs. This example combines Optuna for hyperparameter optimization and CatBoost for model training. 

1. Prerequisites
ClearML Account and Server: You'll need a ClearML server to track your experiments and a configured ClearML client (installed with pip install clearml, and initialized with clearml-init).
ClearML Agent: You'll need a ClearML Agent configured to listen on a queue for your GPU-accelerated tasks. The agent needs to be configured to handle multiple GPUs. For instance, to allocate 4 GPUs, you could use a command like: clearml-agent daemon --gpus 0,1,2,3 --queue my_gpu_queue --docker.
Optuna and CatBoost: Install these libraries: pip install optuna catboost 

2. Python script (e.g., gpu_catboost_optuna.py)
A script using ClearML, Optuna, and CatBoost for hyperparameter optimization on multiple GPUs can be found at optuna-examples and ClearML. The script initializes a ClearML Task and defines an Optuna objective function. This function trains a CatBoost model with suggested hyperparameters, specifying task_type="GPU" and devices='0,1,2,3' to utilize 4 GPUs, and includes an Optuna pruning callback. 
ClearML's HyperParameterOptimizer is configured using a template task, defining the search space, specifying Optuna as the optimizer, directing tasks to a specific queue, and setting the maximum number of concurrent tasks to 4 for parallel execution on the available GPUs. 

3. Explanation and Orchestration
The script sets up a ClearML Task and an Optuna objective function for training a CatBoost model on the breast cancer dataset, configured to use 4 GPUs via task_type="GPU" and devices='0,1,2,3'. It incorporates an Optuna pruning callback for early stopping. 
ClearML's HyperParameterOptimizer manages the process, using a template_task, defining hyperparameter ranges, specifying Optuna as the optimizer, using a designated execution queue, and setting max_number_of_concurrent_tasks to 4 for parallel trials. The clearml-agent on the configured machine handles picking up and executing these tasks. 

4. Execution
Run the script: python gpu_catboost_optuna.py

Monitor in ClearML UI: The ClearML UI displays the optimization task and its sub-tasks (trials) running on the GPUs.

Analyze Results: After completion, the best experiment's details are printed, and results can be reviewed in the ClearML UI. 

This outlines a basic example of GPU orchestration with ClearML, Optuna, and CatBoost. Further customization can include more advanced features from these libraries or ClearML's data management tools.
